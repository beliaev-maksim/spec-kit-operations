## 🔍 Example Initiative Flow

### Legal Team: GDPR Compliance

**Step 1: Specify**
```
Input: "Achieve GDPR compliance across all customer data processing 
systems by Q2"

Output:
- Objective: Ensure full GDPR compliance to mitigate regulatory risk
- KR1: Audit 100% of systems handling customer data by April 30
- KR2: Remediate 95% of identified gaps by May 31
- KR3: Achieve 100% employee training completion by June 15
- KR4: Pass external audit with zero critical findings by Q2 end

Scenarios:
- P1: Audit critical customer-facing systems (8 weeks)
- P2: Gap remediation and documentation updates (6 weeks)
- P3: Employee training program rollout (4 weeks)

Sizing: ⚠️ Warning - 4 KRs suggests significant scope. Consider:
  Phase 1 (Q2): Audit + critical remediations (P1, P2)
  Phase 2 (Q3): Training + full compliance validation (P3)
```

**Step 2: Plan**
```
Stakeholder Analysis:
- Accountable: Chief Legal Officer
- Responsible: Legal team + IT Security
- Consulted: Engineering, Product, Customer Success
- Informed: All employees

Process Maps:
- Current: 15 systems, inconsistent data handling
- Future: Standardized data processing, documented controls

Communication Plan:
- Week 1: Executive briefing
- Week 2: Department head workshops
- Ongoing: Monthly compliance updates

Training:
- Legal team: Deep dive (16 hours)
- Developers: Technical controls (8 hours)
- All staff: Awareness (2 hours)
```

**Step 3: Tasks**
```
Phase 2: Foundational
- [ ] T006 Conduct kickoff workshop with Legal + IT Security
- [ ] T007 [P] Inventory all systems handling customer data
- [ ] T008 Secure budget approval for external audit firm

Phase 3: Scenario 1 - Audit Critical Systems (P1)
- [ ] T013 [P] [S1] Engage external GDPR audit firm
- [ ] T014 [S1] Conduct audit of 8 customer-facing systems
- [ ] T015 [S1] Document findings in audit report
- [ ] T017 [P] [S1] Create remediation plan for critical findings

Phase 4: Scenario 2 - Gap Remediation (P2)
- [ ] T025 [S2] Update data processing agreements
- [ ] T026 [P] [S2] Implement technical controls (encryption, access logs)
- [ ] T027 [S2] Update privacy policy and cookie consent
- [ ] T028 [S2] Obtain legal approval on documentation
```

**Step 4: Implement & Validate**
```
Execution:
- Weeks 1-2: Foundational (system inventory, budget)
- Weeks 3-10: Scenario 1 (audit critical systems)
- Weeks 11-16: Scenario 2 (remediate gaps)
- Weeks 17-20: Scenario 3 (training rollout)

Validation:
- KR1: ✅ 100% of systems audited (May 2)
- KR2: ✅ 97% of gaps remediated (June 1)
- KR3: ✅ 100% training completion (June 14)
- KR4: ✅ External audit passed with 1 minor finding (June 30)
