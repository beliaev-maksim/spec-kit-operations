## How to Use the Transformed Spec-Kit for OKR Planning

### For Business Teams (Legal, HR, Sales Ops, Marketing, etc.)

1. **Start with `/speckit.specify`**:
   - Describe your annual OKR or business initiative in natural language
   - AI will generate a rigorous initiative specification with:
     - SMART objectives
     - Quantified Key Results with baselines
     - Business scenarios prioritized for incremental value
     - Initiative sizing assessment (with breakdown if too large)
     - Stakeholder mapping
     - Resource requirements
     - Success validation criteria

2. **Use `/speckit.clarify`** (if needed):
   - AI will ask up to 5 targeted clarification questions
   - Focus on critical scope, budget, timeline, or stakeholder decisions
   - Answers get integrated back into the spec

3. **Run `/speckit.plan`**:
   - AI performs stakeholder analysis
   - Creates execution plan with change management strategy
   - Develops communication and training plans
   - Maps out process changes
   - Establishes measurement framework

4. **Generate `/speckit.tasks`**:
   - Breaks initiative into actionable business tasks
   - Organized by business scenario (P1, P2, P3)
   - Includes workshops, communications, approvals, training, validation
   - Clear ownership and dependencies

5. **Validate with `/speckit.analyze`**:
   - Checks OKR quality (SMART criteria)
   - Validates KPI measurability
   - Assesses initiative sizing
   - Identifies risks and dependencies
   - Confirms resource feasibility

6. **Execute with `/speckit.implement`**:
   - Guides through initiative execution
   - Tracks stakeholder touchpoints
   - Monitors milestone completion
   - Validates outcomes against KRs

## Next Steps for Completing the Transformation

**Priority Order**:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Transform remaining command files (plan, tasks, analyze, clarify, implement)
2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Update constitution template with business governance principles
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Update agent-file-template to position AI as business consultant
4. **LOW PRIORITY**: Update checklist-template with business validation checklists

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test with sample initiatives from each function (HR, Legal, Sales Ops, Marketing, Finance)
- Validate that OKR quality guidelines are enforced
- Ensure initiative sizing recommendations are triggered appropriately
- Verify business language throughout (no code/technical jargon)
- Check that change management is addressed in every workflow
