# Tasks: [INITIATIVE NAME]

**Input**: Planning documents from `/specs/[###-initiative-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for scenarios), stakeholder-analysis.md, communication-plan.md, execution-guide.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by initiative scenario (from spec.md) to enable independent execution and validation of each business outcome.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Scenario] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different owners, no dependencies)
- **[Scenario]**: Which business scenario this task belongs to (e.g., S1, S2, S3)
- Include exact deliverable names and owners in descriptions

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - Business scenarios from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Initiative requirements from plan.md
  - Stakeholder needs from stakeholder-analysis.md
  - Communication activities from communication-plan.md
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by business scenario so each scenario can be:
  - Executed independently
  - Validated independently
  - Delivered as an incremental value add
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

- [ ] T005 Finalize and get approval on initiative plan.md from executive sponsor

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Activities (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all scenarios
- **Business Scenarios (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Scenarios can then proceed in parallel (if resources allow)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Closure & Sustainment (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired scenarios being complete

### Scenario Dependencies

- **Scenario 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other scenarios
- **Scenario 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May build on S1 but should be independently validatable
- **Scenario 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May leverage S1/S2 learnings but should be independently validatable

### Within Each Scenario

- Planning & design before execution
- Documentation & approvals before rollout
- Communication & training before/during rollout
- Validation after execution complete
- Feedback loops throughout

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all scenarios can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each scenario, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different scenarios can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: Scenario 1

```text
# Launch all planning activities for Scenario 1 together:
Task: "Conduct working session with [stakeholder group]"
Task: "Design forms, templates, or tools needed"
Task: "Create communication materials"

# Launch all training delivery in parallel:
Task: "Deliver training to [user group 1]"
Task: "Deliver training to [user group 2]"
```

## Execution Strategy

### MVP First (Scenario 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all scenarios)
3. Complete Phase 3: Scenario 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Measure Scenario 1 outcomes against validation criteria
5. Review results with stakeholders before proceeding

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Execute Scenario 1 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí Review results (MVP!)
3. Execute Scenario 2 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí Review results
4. Execute Scenario 3 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí Review results
5. Each scenario adds value without disrupting previous scenarios

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple team members or workstreams:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Team Member A / Workstream 1: Scenario 1
   - Team Member B / Workstream 2: Scenario 2
   - Team Member C / Workstream 3: Scenario 3
3. Scenarios complete and validate independently with coordination touchpoints

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different owners/workstreams, no dependencies
- [Scenario] label maps task to specific business scenario for traceability
- Each scenario should be independently completable and validatable
- Gather stakeholder feedback continuously throughout execution
- Adjust course based on data and feedback
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate scenario independently before proceeding
- Avoid: vague tasks, overlapping responsibilities, scenario dependencies that break independence

## Task Execution Best Practices

1. **Clear Ownership**: Every task should have a named owner
2. **Definition of Done**: Each task should have clear completion criteria
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve right people at right time
4. **Documentation**: Keep records of decisions, feedback, and changes
5. **Communication**: Update stakeholders regularly on progress
6. **Measurement**: Track metrics continuously, not just at the end
7. **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adjust based on feedback and learnings
8. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge progress and successes along the way
