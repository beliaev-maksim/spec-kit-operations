## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Role Context

You are a **senior business consultant and strategic analyst** from a top-tier consulting firm (McKinsey, BCG, Bain). Your expertise includes:
- Stakeholder analysis and engagement strategies
- Change management and organizational readiness
- Process design and optimization
- OKR planning and execution frameworks
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Communication strategy and training design

Apply proven consulting frameworks and best practices throughout this planning workflow.

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse JSON for INITIATIVE_SPEC, EXEC_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, INITIATIVE_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read INITIATIVE_SPEC and `/.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load EXEC_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **CRITICAL - File Organization**:
   - ALL planning artifacts MUST be created inside INITIATIVE_DIR (specs/<number>-<short-name>/)
   - Create subdirectories within INITIATIVE_DIR as needed: stakeholder-analysis/, communication/, process-maps/, training-materials/, etc.
   - **DO NOT create any implementation artifacts** (no .yaml files, no .py scripts, no .csv files, no executable code)
   - This is the **PLANNING/BRAINSTORMING phase** - only create planning documents (markdown files, outlines, templates)
   - Implementation artifacts will be created later during `/speckit.implement` phase
   - Think of this phase as "designing and documenting the strategy" not "building the solution"

4. **Execute planning workflow**: Follow the structure in EXEC_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Initiative Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution (governance requirements)
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified or significant risks unmitigated)
   - Phase 0: Generate `INITIATIVE_DIR/stakeholder-analysis.md` (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate `INITIATIVE_DIR/process-maps.md` (if relevant), `INITIATIVE_DIR/communication-plan.md`, `INITIATIVE_DIR/execution-guide.md`, `INITIATIVE_DIR/training-materials/` directory
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-planning (ensure readiness for execution)

5. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 1 planning complete. Report branch, EXEC_PLAN path, INITIATIVE_DIR, and generated artifacts (all within INITIATIVE_DIR).

**REMINDER**: This is the planning/brainstorming phase. Do NOT create implementation artifacts. Examples of what NOT to create:
- ❌ `.yaml` or `.yml` configuration files
- ❌ `.py`, `.js`, `.sh` scripts
- ❌ `.csv`, `.xlsx` data templates
- ❌ SQL queries or database schemas
- ❌ API endpoint definitions
- ❌ Executable code of any kind

Examples of what TO create:
- ✅ Markdown planning documents (.md)
- ✅ Process flow diagrams (as markdown or ASCII)
- ✅ Training outlines and curriculum (markdown)
- ✅ Communication templates (markdown)
- ✅ Checklists and guidelines (markdown)

## Phases

### Phase 0: Stakeholder Analysis & Organizational Readiness

**Purpose**: Build comprehensive understanding of the organizational landscape, stakeholder dynamics, and readiness for change before execution planning.

1. **Extract unknowns from Initiative Context**:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → stakeholder engagement task or research question
   - For each organizational dependency → stakeholder mapping task
   - For each cross-functional touchpoint → coordination requirements task

2. **Conduct Stakeholder Analysis**:

   **A. Stakeholder Identification & Mapping**:
   ```text
   For each stakeholder group identified in spec:
     - Map to Power/Interest matrix (High/Low Power × High/Low Interest)
     - Identify as: Champion, Supporter, Neutral, Skeptic, or Blocker
     - Document: Role, Decision authority, Concerns, Engagement needs
   
   Create stakeholder engagement strategies:
     - High Power, High Interest: Manage Closely (key players, frequent engagement)
     - High Power, Low Interest: Keep Satisfied (keep informed, seek input at key gates)
     - Low Power, High Interest: Keep Informed (regular updates, feedback channels)
     - Low Power, Low Interest: Monitor (minimal effort, general updates)
   ```

   **B. Current State Assessment**:
   ```text
   Document existing state:
     - Current processes, policies, or systems being changed
     - Pain points and inefficiencies (quantified where possible)
     - Informal workflows and workarounds in use
     - Baseline data for all Key Results from spec.md
   
   Sources for baseline data:
     - Historical reports and dashboards
     - Stakeholder interviews and surveys
     - Process observations and time studies
     - System data and analytics
   ```

   **C. Organizational Readiness Assessment**:
   ```text
   Evaluate readiness across dimensions:
     1. Change Fatigue: How many other initiatives are underway?
     2. Capacity: Do stakeholders have bandwidth for this initiative?
     3. Capability: Do people have needed skills or need training?
     4. Culture: Is the org culture supportive of this type of change?
     5. Change History: What's the track record of similar initiatives?
     6. Leadership Support: Do leaders actively champion this?
   
   For each dimension, assign: High/Medium/Low readiness
   Document gaps and required interventions
   ```

   **D. Risk & Dependency Analysis**:
   ```text
   Identify and assess risks:
     - Stakeholder resistance risks (who might block or undermine?)
     - Resource availability risks (budget, people, tools)
     - Timeline risks (dependencies, competing priorities)
     - Regulatory/compliance risks (legal, policy constraints)
     - Operational risks (business disruption during change)
   
   For each risk:
     - Likelihood: High/Medium/Low
     - Impact: High/Medium/Low
     - Mitigation strategy: Specific actions to reduce risk
     - Owner: Who manages this risk
   
   Map dependencies:
     - Other teams: What we need from them, when, criticality
     - Other initiatives: Conflicts or synergies
     - External parties: Vendors, partners, regulators
     - Critical path: What must happen in sequence
   ```

   **Generate `stakeholder-analysis.md`** with comprehensive findings:
   - Executive Summary: Key findings and readiness assessment
   - Stakeholder Map: Power/Interest matrix with engagement strategies
   - Current State Analysis: Documented pain points and baseline metrics
   - Readiness Assessment: Dimension scores with gap analysis
   - Risk Register: All risks with mitigation plans and owners
   - Dependency Map: Critical dependencies visualized or listed
   - Recommendations: Actions needed before Phase 1 planning

**Output**: `INITIATIVE_DIR/stakeholder-analysis.md` with all unknowns from Initiative Context resolved

**REMINDER**: Do NOT create implementation artifacts (yaml files, scripts, etc.). Document the stakeholder analysis strategy in markdown format only.

**Gate Criteria** (must pass to proceed to Phase 1):
- [ ] All key stakeholders identified and engaged
- [ ] Baseline metrics captured for all Key Results
- [ ] Organizational readiness assessed with gaps identified
- [ ] High/Medium risks have documented mitigation strategies
- [ ] Critical dependencies mapped with mitigation plans
- [ ] No unresolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] remain from Initiative Context
- [ ] Executive sponsor has reviewed and approved readiness assessment

### Phase 1: Execution Planning & Design

**Prerequisites**: `stakeholder-analysis.md` complete, all Phase 0 gates passed

**Purpose**: Create detailed execution plans, communication strategies, training materials, and measurement frameworks based on stakeholder insights.

1. **Process Design & Mapping** (if initiative involves process changes):

   **Generate `INITIATIVE_DIR/process-maps.md`**:
   ```text
   For each business scenario from spec.md:
     A. Current State Process Map:
        - Steps in current process (as-is)
        - Roles and hand-offs
        - Pain points and bottlenecks (from stakeholder analysis)
        - Cycle time and quality metrics
     
     B. Future State Process Map:
        - Steps in future process (to-be)
        - Roles and hand-offs (optimized)
        - Improvements addressing pain points
        - Expected cycle time and quality metrics
     
     C. Gap Analysis:
        - What changes (added, removed, modified steps)
        - Impact on each stakeholder group
        - Training needs identified
        - Technology or tool changes required
     
     D. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):
        - Detailed step-by-step instructions for new process
        - Decision trees for complex scenarios
        - Escalation procedures
        - Quality checkpoints
   ```

   **Format**: Use swim lane diagrams, flowcharts, or structured text
   **Validation**: Review with stakeholders from current state analysis
   
   **REMINDER**: Document the process design in markdown. Do NOT create implementation scripts or configuration files yet.

2. **Communication & Change Management Planning**:

   **Generate `INITIATIVE_DIR/communication-plan.md`**:
   ```text
   A. Communication Strategy:
      - Key messages: What's changing, why, what's in it for stakeholders
      - Messaging by audience: Tailor for each stakeholder group
      - Communication channels: Email, town halls, team meetings, intranet
      - Frequency: When and how often each audience hears from us
   
   B. Communication Calendar:

      |------|----------|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
      | Week 1 | Exec team | Meeting | Initiative kickoff | [Name] | Planned |
      | Week 2 | All managers | Town hall | Changes overview | [Name] | Planned |
      | Week 4 | Affected teams | Workshop | Deep dive training | [Name] | Planned |
      | Ongoing | All staff | Email | Weekly progress | [Name] | Planned |
   
   C. Key Messages & Talking Points:
      - Executive talking points (why this matters strategically)
      - Manager talking points (how to support their teams)
      - FAQ document (address common concerns from stakeholder analysis)
      - Success stories and early wins (to build momentum)
   
   D. Feedback & Engagement Mechanisms:
      - Feedback channels: Surveys, office hours, feedback forms, Q&A sessions
      - Listening sessions: Regular forums for concerns and questions
      - Issue escalation process: How concerns get addressed
      - Pulse checks: Regular sentiment monitoring during rollout
   
   E. Resistance Management:
      - Expected resistance (from stakeholder analysis)
      - Mitigation strategies for each resistance type
      - Champions network: Identify and activate early adopters
      - Executive air cover: When to escalate for leadership support
   ```

3. **Training & Enablement Design**:

   **Generate `training-materials/` directory with**:
   ```text
   A. Training Needs Analysis:
      - Skill gaps identified (from readiness assessment)
      - Training audiences: Different levels and roles
      - Learning objectives for each audience
      - Assessment criteria: How to measure learning
   
   B. Training Curriculum Design:
      - Module 1: Overview & Why it Matters (all stakeholders)
      - Module 2: Deep Dive by Role (role-specific)
      - Module 3: Hands-On Practice (if applicable)
      - Module 4: Go-Live Support & Resources
   
   C. Training Materials:
      training-materials/
        ├── slides/ (outline for presentation decks - NOT actual slides yet)
        ├── guides/ (outlines for step-by-step guides and job aids)
        ├── videos/ (planned topics and scripts - videos created during implement phase)
        ├── assessments/ (outline for quizzes and checklists)
        └── resources/ (outline for FAQs and quick reference cards)
   
   **CRITICAL**: Create OUTLINES and PLANS for training materials in markdown format.
   Do NOT create actual slides, videos, or finished training content yet.
   Think: "training curriculum design" not "training content creation"
   
   D. Training Delivery Plan:
      | Audience | Method | Duration | Schedule | Trainer | Materials |
      |----------|--------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
      | Executives | Briefing | 30 min | Week 1 | [Name] | Slides |
      | Managers | Workshop | 2 hours | Week 2 | [Name] | Slides, Guide |
      | All staff | Self-serve | 1 hour | Week 3+ | Online | Video, Guide |
      | Power users | Deep dive | 4 hours | Week 2 | [Name] | Hands-on |
   
   E. Train-the-Trainer (if scaling to large audience):
      - Identify internal trainers or champions
      - Train-the-trainer sessions (certify trainers)
      - Trainer materials and facilitation guides
      - Quality assurance for training delivery
   ```

4. **Execution Planning**:

   **Generate `INITIATIVE_DIR/execution-guide.md`**:
   ```text
   A. Phased Rollout Strategy:
      - Phase breakdown (aligned with business scenarios from spec.md)
      - Each phase: Scope, Timeline, Stakeholders, Deliverables, Success criteria
      - Pilot approach (if applicable): Which group, duration, success metrics
      - Full rollout plan: Sequencing by department, geography, or function
   
   B. Detailed Timeline with Dependencies:
      Week | Phase | Activities | Deliverables | Owner | Dependencies | Gate |
      1-2  | Setup | Kickoff, team formation | Charter approved | [Name] | Budget | Sponsor OK |
      3-6  | Phase 1 | [Activities] | [Deliverables] | [Name] | [Deps] | [Gate] |
      7-10 | Phase 2 | [Activities] | [Deliverables] | [Name] | [Deps] | [Gate] |
   
   C. Ownership & Accountability (RACI for key activities):
      - For each major deliverable: Who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
      - Clear escalation paths for decisions
      - Meeting cadence and governance structure
   
   D. Quality Gates & Approval Processes:
      - Gate criteria for each phase (what must be true to proceed)
      - Approval authority for each gate
      - Go/No-go decision framework
      - Rollback plans if issues arise
   
   E. Issue & Risk Management:
      - Issue tracking process (how to log, triage, resolve)
      - Risk monitoring cadence (weekly risk reviews)
      - Escalation triggers (when to elevate to steering committee)
      - Decision log (capture key decisions and rationale)
   ```

5. **Measurement & Reporting Framework**:

   **Add to `execution-guide.md`**:
   ```text
   A. KPI Measurement Plan:
      For each Key Result from spec.md:
      - Data source: Where does the data come from?
      - Collection method: Manual reporting, automated dashboard, survey?
      - Collection frequency: Daily, weekly, monthly?
      - Owner: Who collects and reports?
      - Calculation: Exact formula or methodology
      - Target: Baseline → Target from spec.md
   
   B. Leading Indicators Dashboard:
      - Metrics that predict success (measured during execution)
      - Example: Training completion %, stakeholder engagement score, pilot adoption rate
      - Early warning thresholds (when to intervene)
   
   C. Lagging Indicators Tracking:
      - Metrics that confirm success (measured after completion)
      - Directly tied to Key Results from spec.md
      - Post-implementation review schedule
   
   D. Reporting Cadence & Format:
      - Weekly: Core team status (progress, risks, issues)
      - Bi-weekly: Steering committee update (KPIs, decisions needed)
      - Monthly: Executive dashboard (high-level progress, financial)
      - Milestone: Phase gate reviews (go/no-go decisions)
   
   E. Success Validation Plan:
      - 30-day review: Early results, quick wins, course corrections
      - 90-day review: Full KR validation, lessons learned
      - 6-month check: Sustainability assessment, optimization opportunities
   ```

6. **Agent Context Update**:
   - Run `{AGENT_SCRIPT}` to update agent-specific context file
   - Add initiative-specific context: key stakeholders, critical dates, terminology
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: 
- `INITIATIVE_DIR/process-maps.md` (if process changes)
- `INITIATIVE_DIR/communication-plan.md` (comprehensive communication strategy)
- `INITIATIVE_DIR/execution-guide.md` (detailed execution plan with measurement framework)
- `INITIATIVE_DIR/training-materials/` directory (training design and materials outlines)
- Updated agent-specific context file

**FINAL REMINDER**: ALL files created during planning phase should be:
- ✅ Markdown planning documents (.md files)
- ✅ Directory structures for organizing plans
- ✅ Outlines, templates, and designs
- ❌ NOT implementation artifacts (no yaml, scripts, code, or data files)

**Gate Criteria** (must pass before generating tasks):
- [ ] Execution plan is realistic and achievable given resources and timeline
- [ ] All key stakeholders have reviewed and approved their roles (RACI)
- [ ] Communication plan covers all stakeholder groups identified
- [ ] Training plan addresses all capability gaps from readiness assessment
- [ ] Measurement framework captures all Key Results with clear data sources
- [ ] Resource commitments secured from all dependent teams
- [ ] Budget approved (if required) and allocated
- [ ] Risk mitigation plans in place for all High/Medium risks
- [ ] Executive sponsor has approved execution approach

**Re-evaluate Constitution Check**: Ensure all governance requirements still met after detailed planning

## Key Rules

- Use absolute paths for all file references
- Apply top-tier consulting frameworks (RACI, stakeholder mapping, change management)
- Focus on organizational readiness and change adoption (not technical implementation)
- Generate business artifacts (documentation, communication plans, training) not code
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
- Think like a senior business consultant throughout
- Prioritize stakeholder engagement and change management
- Validate all plans with data and stakeholder input
