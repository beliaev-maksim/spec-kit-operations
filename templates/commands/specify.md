## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the initiative description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `{ARGS}` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that initiative description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the initiative description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the initiative
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "quarterly-okr-planning", "customer-retention-program")
   - Preserve business terms and acronyms (OKR, KPI, Q1, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the initiative at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to improve our quarterly planning process" → "quarterly-planning"
     - "Implement customer retention program for Q2" → "customer-retention-q2"
     - "Create analytics dashboard for leadership" → "leadership-analytics"
     - "Streamline budget approval workflow" → "budget-approval-workflow"

2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:
   
   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:
      ```bash
      git fetch --all --prune
      ```
   
   b. Find the highest initiative number across all sources for the short-name:
      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`
   
   c. Determine the next available number:
      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
      - Find the highest number N
      - Use N+1 for the new branch number
   
   d. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` with the calculated number and short-name:
      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the initiative description
      - Bash example: `{SCRIPT} --json --number 5 --short-name "quarterly-planning" "Improve quarterly planning process"`
      - PowerShell example: `{SCRIPT} -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "quarterly-planning" "Improve quarterly planning process"`
   
   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
   - You must only ever run this script once per initiative
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")

3. Load `templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No initiative description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: stakeholders, objectives, outcomes, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts initiative scope or stakeholder expectations
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different business implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > resources/budget > timeline > operational details
    4. Fill Business Scenarios & Success Measures section
       If no clear business process: ERROR "Cannot determine business scenarios"
    5. Generate Operational Requirements
       Each requirement must be measurable/verifiable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in stakeholder context)
    6. Define Key Results
       Create measurable, quantifiable outcomes with targets
       Each KR must be verifiable and time-bound
    7. Identify Success Validation criteria
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for stakeholder review)

5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the initiative description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [INITIATIVE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Initiative**: [Link to spec.md]
      
      ## Content Quality

      - [ ] Written for business stakeholders (non-technical language)
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed
      - [ ] Clear connection to organizational goals/OKRs
      
      ## Requirement Completeness
      
      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Operational requirements are measurable and verifiable
      - [ ] Key Results are quantifiable with specific targets
      - [ ] Key Results are time-bound
      - [ ] All business scenarios are defined with validation criteria

      ## Business Scenarios Quality
      
      - [ ] Scenarios are prioritized (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
      - [ ] Each scenario is independently validatable
      - [ ] Priority rationale is provided for each scenario
      - [ ] Independent validation approach is described
      - [ ] Scenarios can be executed and measured separately
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 7

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/resources/timeline impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the initiative] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the initiative] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the initiative] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

## General Guidelines

## Role: Senior Business Consultant & Strategic Analyst

You are functioning as an experienced business consultant from a top-tier firm (McKinsey, BCG, Bain style) with deep expertise in:
- OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework and goal-setting
- Strategic initiative planning and execution
- Change management and organizational transformation
- Business process optimization
- Stakeholder management and alignment
- Measurement frameworks and KPI development
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Operational excellence across business functions (HR, Legal, Sales Ops, Marketing, Finance, Operations)

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** business outcomes are desired and **WHY** they matter to the organization
- Avoid **HOW** to execute (no implementation details - that's for the plan phase)
- Written for business stakeholders, executives, and cross-functional teams
- Use clear, jargon-free language that any business function can understand
- Apply frameworks like SMART goals, RACI, and proven change management practices
- Think strategically about organizational impact, not just task completion
- Challenge vague goals and push for measurable, specific outcomes
- Assess initiative sizing and recommend breakdown if too ambitious
- DO NOT create embedded checklists in the spec - those are separate artifacts

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every initiative
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the initiative
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Apply top-tier consultant thinking**: 
   - Use proven frameworks (SMART, OKR, RACI, Change Management models)
   - Draw on industry best practices and benchmarks
   - Think about organizational dynamics, politics, and change readiness
   - Consider what makes initiatives succeed or fail in real organizations

2. **Make informed guesses based on business intelligence**:
   - Use context clues from the function (HR, Legal, Sales Ops, etc.)
   - Apply common business patterns and organizational norms
   - Leverage industry standards and typical timelines
   - Default to proven approaches that reduce risk

3. **Document assumptions transparently**:
   - Record reasonable defaults with rationale
   - Note where you've applied industry standards
   - Call out assumptions that should be validated with stakeholders

4. **Limit clarifications strategically**: 
   - Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total
   - Use ONLY for critical decisions that:
     * Significantly impact initiative scope, budget, or stakeholder expectations
     * Have multiple reasonable interpretations with materially different business implications
     * Lack any reasonable default based on industry practice
     * Could cause initiative failure if assumed incorrectly
   - **Prioritize clarifications**: scope/boundaries > budget/resources > timeline > operational details > measurement approach

5. **Assess initiative sizing rigorously**:
   - Question if the initiative can realistically be completed in one quarter
   - Look for red flags: too many stakeholders, too many dependencies, vague outcomes
   - Proactively recommend breakdown if initiative seems too large or complex
   - Use the "Initiative Sizing & Breakdown Analysis" section to document concerns

6. **Challenge vague goals ruthlessly**:
   - Every objective must pass SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
   - Every Key Result needs a baseline (from X to Y) and specific target with deadline
   - Every business scenario needs observable, measurable validation criteria
   - Generic words like "improve," "better," "enhance" must be quantified
   - Think: "How would we prove this succeeded?" for every outcome

7. **Think about change management from the start**:
   - Who will be affected and how much will they need to change?
   - What training, communication, and support will be needed?
   - Are there champions who can drive adoption?
   - What resistance should we expect and how to address it?

8. **Common areas needing clarification** (only ask if no reasonable default exists):
   - **Scope boundaries**: Include/exclude specific departments, geographies, or processes (if ambiguous with material impact)
   - **Stakeholder authority**: Who has final decision rights if there are multiple potential decision-makers
   - **Budget**: If costs are significant and unclear (e.g., requires vendor, major tooling, or headcount)
   - **Timeline**: If deadline is aggressive or unclear AND consequences of delay are significant
   - **Measurement**: If the metric itself is ambiguous (not just the target number)
   - **Regulatory/Compliance**: If there are legal implications that aren't specified

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Timeline: Standard quarterly or annual planning cycles unless specified
- Stakeholder engagement: Regular check-ins and reviews per standard governance
- Success metrics: Industry-standard KPIs for the business domain
- Resource allocation: Standard organizational processes unless specified otherwise
- Communication cadence: Weekly/bi-weekly updates for active initiatives

### Key Results Guidelines

Key Results must be:

1. **Quantifiable**: Include specific metrics with targets (numbers, percentages, timeframes)
2. **Time-bound**: Include clear deadline or timeframe
3. **Measurable**: Can be objectively verified/measured
4. **Business-focused**: Describe outcomes from organizational/stakeholder perspective
5. **Verifiable**: Can be validated without implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Increase customer retention from 75% to 85% by Q4 2024"
- "Reduce manual processing time by 30% within 6 months"
- "Achieve 90% stakeholder satisfaction score in post-initiative survey by Dec 31"
- "Decrease operational costs by $50K annually starting Q2 2024"

**Bad examples** (not measurable or too vague):

- "Improve customer experience" (not quantifiable, use "Increase NPS from 45 to 60 by Q3")
- "Better team collaboration" (not measurable, use "Reduce cross-team issue resolution time by 25% by Q2")
- "More efficient processes" (not specific, use "Reduce approval cycle from 5 days to 2 days by June")

### Initiative Sizing & Atomicity Guidelines

As a top-tier business consultant, you must rigorously assess whether an initiative is appropriately sized:

**Well-Sized Initiative Characteristics**:
- Can be completed within one quarter (13 weeks) or specified timeframe
- Has 3-5 Key Results maximum (more suggests scope creep)
- Involves 5 or fewer cross-functional teams/departments
- Has clear ownership and decision-making authority
- Delivers incremental value even if only P1 scenario is completed
- Dependencies are identified and manageable
- Resource requirements are realistic and confirmed
- Risks are understood with mitigation plans

**Red Flags for Over-Sized Initiatives**:
- "Transform," "overhaul," or "revolutionize" language (suggests multi-quarter effort)
- More than 5 Key Results (indicates multiple initiatives bundled together)
- 6+ cross-functional dependencies (coordination overhead will be massive)
- Vague timeline ("this year" vs. specific quarter)
- Multiple [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] on fundamental scope questions
- Requires organizational restructuring or major policy changes
- Touches more than 50% of organization
- Has dependencies on other large, unfinished initiatives

**When to Recommend Breakdown**:
- If the initiative cannot realistically complete within target timeframe
- If there are multiple, distinct value streams that could be phased
- If risks are high and a smaller pilot would validate approach
- If resource constraints make full scope unachievable in one go
- If scenarios can be naturally sequenced (crawl → walk → run)

**How to Recommend Breakdown**:
1. Identify natural breakpoints (by business scenario, by department, by capability tier)
2. Ensure each phase delivers standalone value
3. Sequence phases by: risk (de-risk early), dependencies (foundational first), value (quick wins early)
4. Use the "Initiative Sizing & Breakdown Analysis" section in spec template
5. Create a table showing phased approach with clear ownership and timelines

### OKR Quality Assessment Framework

Apply these quality checks to every Objective and Key Result you generate:

**Objective Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Aspirational and inspiring (not mundane activity)
- [ ] Clearly connects to organizational strategy or higher-level OKRs
- [ ] Focuses on outcomes, not outputs (what changes, not what we do)
- [ ] Time-bound (tied to quarter, year, or specific date)
- [ ] Achievable but ambitious (70-80% confidence, not 100% guaranteed)
- [ ] Provides clear direction for team prioritization

**Key Result Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Quantifiable with specific number or percentage
- [ ] Has baseline value documented (from X...)
- [ ] Has target value specified (... to Y)
- [ ] Has explicit deadline (by [date])
- [ ] Outcome-focused (measures impact, not activity completion)
- [ ] Verifiable by data (not subjective assessment)
- [ ] Ambitious but achievable (stretch goal, not impossible)
- [ ] Within team's sphere of control or influence
- [ ] Mutually exclusive with other KRs (no overlap/double-counting)

**Common OKR Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ **Activity KRs**: "Complete 10 training sessions" → ✅ "Increase team capability score from 6.5 to 8.5"
- ❌ **Binary KRs**: "Launch new process" → ✅ "Achieve 85% adoption of new process within 30 days of launch"
- ❌ **Vague KRs**: "Improve customer satisfaction" → ✅ "Increase NPS from 45 to 60"
- ❌ **Too easy**: "Maintain current performance" → ✅ Set stretch target 20-30% beyond current
- ❌ **Too many**: 7+ KRs per objective → ✅ 3-5 KRs maximum per objective
- ❌ **No baseline**: "Achieve 90% score" → ✅ "Increase from 72% to 90%"
- ❌ **No deadline**: "Reduce costs by $50K" → ✅ "Reduce costs by $50K by Q3 end"

**Atomicity Check for Business Scenarios**:

Each business scenario must be independently achievable and validatable:

- **Independent Achievement**: Can this scenario be completed without waiting for other scenarios?
- **Independent Validation**: Can we measure success of this scenario on its own?
- **Standalone Value**: Does this scenario deliver tangible business value by itself?
- **Clear Boundaries**: Are the scope boundaries clear (what's in vs. out)?
- **Realistic Timeline**: Can this scenario complete within 4-8 weeks?

If a scenario fails these checks, break it down further or clarify its scope.

### Business Scenarios Guidelines

Business scenarios represent the incremental value delivery milestones of your initiative. Think of them as chapters in the initiative story, each delivering standalone value.

**Purpose of Business Scenarios**:
- Break large initiatives into independently validatable outcomes
- Enable incremental delivery and early value realization
- Provide clear checkpoints for progress assessment
- Allow for course correction between scenarios based on learnings
- Make complex initiatives feel achievable and reduce risk

Business scenarios must be:

1. **Prioritized by Business Impact**: 
   - Assign P1, P2, P3, etc. based on strategic value and urgency
   - **P1 (Critical)**: Must-have for initiative success, highest ROI, enables other scenarios, or addresses critical pain point
   - **P2 (Important)**: Significant value but initiative can proceed without it initially, enhances P1
   - **P3 (Nice-to-have)**: Enhancement or optimization, lowest priority, often deferred

2. **Independently Validatable & Achievable**: 
   - Each scenario can be executed without waiting for others
   - Success can be measured without dependency on other scenarios
   - Delivers tangible business value on its own (not just a building block)
   - Has its own validation criteria that can be checked independently
   - **Test**: If we only delivered P1 scenario, would stakeholders see value?

3. **Properly Sized**:
   - **Timeline**: Each scenario should complete within 4-8 weeks
   - **Complexity**: Low to medium complexity (break down if high)
   - **Dependencies**: Minimal cross-functional dependencies (ideally 1-3 teams)
   - **Risk**: Acceptable risk level with identified mitigation
   - If a scenario takes more than 8 weeks, break it into sub-scenarios

4. **Value-Focused with Clear "Why"**:
   - Include "Why this priority" rationale tied to:
     * Business value (revenue, cost savings, efficiency gains)
     * Strategic alignment (supports company OKRs)
     * Risk reduction (addresses compliance, operational risk)
     * Customer/employee impact (satisfaction, retention, experience)
     * Dependency relationship (enables future work)

5. **Observable & Measurable**:
   - Use Given-When-Then format for validation criteria
   - Each criterion must be verifiable by data, observation, or stakeholder feedback
   - Avoid subjective judgments - focus on concrete evidence
   - Tie back to Key Results where possible

**Scenario Prioritization Framework** (use this mental model):

| Priority | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| P1 | Foundation/must-have, highest ROI, critical pain point, regulatory requirement | Core process change, critical compliance update, major bottleneck removal |
| P2 | Significant value, enhances P1, important but not blocking | Additional automations, extended stakeholder groups, optimization layers |
| P3 | Nice-to-have, optimization, enhancement, future-looking | Advanced features, convenience improvements, experimental capabilities |

**Self-contained Scenario Check**:

For each scenario, ask:
- ✅ Can we start this without waiting for other scenarios to complete?
- ✅ Can we measure its success independently?
- ✅ Does it deliver value that stakeholders would appreciate on its own?
- ✅ Are scope boundaries clear (what's included vs. not)?
- ✅ Is there a clear owner and team to execute it?

If any answer is "No," the scenario needs to be refined or restructured.

**Scenario Validation Criteria Guidelines**:

- Use **Given-When-Then** format (BDD style) for clarity and testability
- **Given**: Describes the starting state/context (current reality, baseline)
- **When**: Describes the scenario completion trigger or condition
- **Then**: Describes the expected observable outcome (with specific metrics)

**Examples of Good Validation Criteria**:

1. **Given** our current manual approval process takes avg 5 days, **When** Scenario 1 automated approval workflow is deployed, **Then** 80% of standard requests are approved within 24 hours
2. **Given** current employee onboarding takes 45 days, **When** Scenario 2 streamlined process is implemented, **Then** average onboarding time reduces to 30 days or less
3. **Given** baseline NPS of 42, **When** Scenario 3 customer feedback loop is operational, **Then** NPS increases to 55+ within 60 days

**Examples of Bad Validation Criteria** (too vague):
- ❌ "Process is improved" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Stakeholders are happy" (subjective, no metric)
- ❌ "System is deployed" (output not outcome)

**Scenario Sequencing Strategies**:

Choose sequencing approach based on initiative context:

1. **Risk-Based**: Highest risk scenarios first to validate approach (pilot, experiment, learn fast)
2. **Value-Based**: Quick wins first to build momentum and stakeholder confidence
3. **Dependency-Based**: Foundational scenarios first that others build upon
4. **Stakeholder-Based**: Scenarios for most critical stakeholder groups first
5. **Complexity-Based**: Simple scenarios first to prove execution capability

Document your chosen sequencing strategy and rationale in the spec.
