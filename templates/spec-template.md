# Initiative Specification: [INITIATIVE NAME]

**Quarter/Period**: [Q1 2024]
**Owner**: [Name/Team]
**Function**: [HR/Legal/Sales Ops/Marketing/Finance/Operations/Other]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Strategic Context *(mandatory)*

[Describe how this initiative aligns with organizational strategy, which company OKRs it supports, and why it's prioritized for this quarter/period]

## Objective *(mandatory)*

[Clear, inspiring statement of what this initiative aims to achieve and why it matters to the organization. Must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).]

**SMART Validation**:
- **Specific**: [Is the objective clear and unambiguous?]
- **Measurable**: [Can progress be tracked quantitatively?]
- **Achievable**: [Is this realistic given resources and constraints?]
- **Relevant**: [Does this align with strategic priorities?]
- **Time-bound**: [Is there a clear deadline or timeframe?]

## Business Scenarios & Success Measures *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Business scenarios should be PRIORITIZED as incremental outcomes ordered by impact.
  Each scenario must be INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATABLE - meaning if you achieve just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable result that delivers measurable value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each scenario, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each scenario as a standalone increment of value that can be:
  - Achieved independently
  - Measured independently  
  - Validated by stakeholders independently
  
  ATOMIC INITIATIVE SIZING:
  Each scenario should be small enough to:
  - Complete within one quarter or less
  - Require minimal cross-functional dependencies
  - Deliver tangible business value on its own
  - Be validated without waiting for other scenarios
  
  If a scenario seems too large, consider breaking it into smaller P1/P2/P3 sub-scenarios.
-->

### Scenario 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this business outcome/change in plain language. Focus on the business capability or operational improvement, not the activities.]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the business impact and why it has this priority level. What makes this the #1 most critical outcome?]

**Sizing Assessment**: 
- **Estimated Timeline**: [e.g., "8-10 weeks"]
- **Team Dependencies**: [e.g., "Requires collaboration with Finance team for 2 workshops"]
- **Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High - explain why]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High - key risks]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently - e.g., "Can be fully measured by [specific KPI/metric] and delivers [specific business value] without depending on Scenario 2 or 3"]

**Validation Criteria** (Must be observable and measurable):

1. **Given** [current situation/baseline], **When** [this scenario is complete], **Then** [expected measurable outcome with specific metric]
2. **Given** [stakeholder group/process], **When** [change is implemented], **Then** [observable behavior change or result]
3. **Given** [system/process state], **When** [trigger event], **Then** [measurable business outcome]

---

### Scenario 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

**Why this priority**: [Explain the business value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Validation Criteria**:

1. **Given** [situation/context], **When** [action/event], **Then** [expected business outcome]

---

### Scenario 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this business scenario/process in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the business value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Validation Criteria**:

1. **Given** [situation/context], **When** [action/event], **Then** [expected business outcome]

## Initiative Sizing & Breakdown Analysis *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Assess whether this initiative is properly sized.
  A well-sized initiative should be achievable within one quarter with the available resources.
  
  If the initiative is too large, use this section to document how it should be broken down.
-->

**Overall Complexity Assessment**: [Low/Medium/High]

**Sizing Validation Checklist**:

- [ ] Can be completed within one quarter (or specified timeframe)?
- [ ] Has clear, measurable success criteria?
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and manageable?
- [ ] Resource requirements are realistic and available?
- [ ] Risks are understood and have mitigation plans?
- [ ] Scenarios are independently achievable and validatable?

**If Initiative is Too Large - Recommended Breakdown**:

<!--
  If any of the above checklist items are "No", the initiative may need to be broken down.
  Document the recommended breakdown approach here.
-->

| Sub-Initiative | Priority | Scope | Timeline | Owner | Dependencies |
|----------------|----------|-------|----------|-------|--------------|
| [Name Phase 1] | P1 | [What's included] | [Q1 2024] | [Team/Person] | [None or list] |
| [Name Phase 2] | P2 | [What's included] | [Q2 2024] | [Team/Person] | [Phase 1 complete] |
| [Name Phase 3] | P3 | [What's included] | [Q3 2024] | [Team/Person] | [Phase 1, 2 complete] |

**Rationale for Breakdown**: [If breakdown recommended, explain why the original scope is too large and how the phased approach reduces risk while delivering incremental value]

### Risk & Challenge Assessment

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with relevant risks and challenges.
-->

- What happens when [resource constraint/external dependency]?
- How do we handle [unexpected business condition]?
- What are the blockers if [key assumption doesn't hold]?

## Key Results *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define quantifiable Key Results that measure success.
  Each KR must be measurable, time-bound, and have a baseline value.
  
  QUALITY CRITERIA FOR KEY RESULTS:
  ✓ Quantifiable with specific numbers/percentages
  ✓ Has clear baseline (from X to Y)
  ✓ Time-bound with explicit deadline
  ✓ Outcome-focused (not activity-based)
  ✓ Verifiable by data/metrics
  ✓ Ambitious but achievable (70-80% confidence)
  
  BAD EXAMPLES (too vague):
  ✗ "Improve employee engagement"
  ✗ "Better compliance processes"
  ✗ "Increase sales"
  
  GOOD EXAMPLES (specific & measurable):
  ✓ "Increase employee engagement score from 6.5 to 8.0 (out of 10) by Q4"
  ✓ "Reduce compliance violations from 12/quarter to <3/quarter by end of H2"
  ✓ "Grow monthly recurring revenue from $500K to $750K (+50%) by Dec 31"
